Permutation Test\n","\n","In a permutation procedure, two or more samples are involved, typically the groups in an A/B or other hypothesis test. *Permute* means to change the order of a set of values. The first step in a permutation test of a hypothesis is to combine the results from groups A and B (and, if used, C, D,…). This is the logical embodiment of the null hypothesis that the treatments to which the groups were exposed do not differ. We then test that hypothesis by randomly drawing groups from this combined set and seeing how much they differ from one another. The permutation procedure is as follows:\n","\n","1. Combine the results from the different groups into a single data set.\n","2. Shuffle the combined data and then randomly draw (without replacement) a resample of the same size as group A (clearly it will contain some data from the other groups).\n","3. From the remaining data, randomly draw (without replacement) a resample of the same size as group B.\n","4. Do the same for groups C, D, and so on.
